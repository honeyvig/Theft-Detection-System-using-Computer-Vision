# Theft-Detection-System-using-Computer-Vision
To develop a Theft Detection System using computer vision and behavioral analysis for detecting employee and customer theft in retail environments, here's a high-level overview of how the project can be approached, broken down into stages:
Project Overview

The system will analyze in-store video feeds (from surveillance cameras) to detect suspicious behaviors related to employee theft during checkout and customer theft while shopping. It will leverage AI models trained to detect specific behaviors and trigger real-time alerts for security teams or store management.
Core Components of the System:

    Data Collection:
        Video Feeds: Collect video data from surveillance cameras in-store.
        Behavioral Data: Label the data for specific activities, such as customers taking items without paying or employees engaging in suspicious checkout behavior.

    Preprocessing and Dataset Creation:
        Frame-by-frame extraction from video.
        Annotations and labeling suspicious activities for training (e.g., shoplifting, suspicious employee actions).
        Augmenting the dataset for more robust training.

    Behavioral Analysis:
        Detect suspicious behavior using pre-trained models or custom models.
        Employee Theft: Detect irregularities such as scanning fewer items than picked or suspicious movements.
        Customer Theft: Detect unusual actions like not scanning items or hiding products in bags.

    Model Selection and Training:
        Pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection or OpenPose for detecting human poses might be useful.
        For behavioral analysis, use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Transformer-based models for sequential anomaly detection.
        Fine-tune the model to identify specific behaviors related to theft.

    Real-Time Processing:
        Implement real-time or near-real-time inference with low latency, possibly using edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson or cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).
        Trigger alerts for unusual behavior (both customer and employee-related).

    Alert System:
        Upon detection, the system should notify store management or security teams with an alert system that includes visual evidence (video clip of the incident).
        The alert can be sent via email, SMS, or directly to a security dashboard.

    Hardware Integration:
        Interface with store surveillance systems (IP cameras, video management systems).
        Ensure the video capture system is capable of streaming or providing footage for processing.

    Optimization:
        Deploy optimized models for edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson).
        Ensure system scalability and low latency in processing.

    Testing and Validation:
        Test in real-world conditions and validate the performance of the system.
        Continuously improve the model's performance by updating training data based on real-world results.

High-Level Steps for Developing the Proof of Concept (POC)
1. Data Collection (1-2 Months):

    Collect Video Feeds: Work with hardware engineers to ensure the cameras are properly installed for optimal coverage of critical areas (checkout counters, aisles).
    Label Data: Manually annotate suspicious behaviors in video data or use automated systems to label common theft actions.
    Dataset Augmentation: For limited data, use augmentation techniques (flipping, rotating, etc.) to diversify the dataset.

2. Model Development (3-4 Months):

    Pre-trained Model Selection: Choose models like YOLO for object detection, OpenPose for human poses, or a 3D CNN for behavioral analysis.
    Custom Model Development: If the pre-trained models don't perform well, train a custom model using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    Anomaly Detection Algorithms: Develop and train models for behavioral anomaly detection using LSTMs or Transformer-based models.

3. Real-time Integration & Testing (2-3 Months):

    Edge Device Integration: Integrate the system with edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson or Coral) to run the models on-device and reduce latency.
    Develop Real-time Processing Pipeline: Set up a pipeline to process video data in real-time, detect suspicious behavior, and trigger alerts.
    Alert System: Implement an alert system with notifications (SMS, email, push notifications to security personnel).

4. Hardware and Software Optimization (1-2 Months):

    Optimize the System: Optimize the performance of the model to run efficiently on hardware with limited resources (e.g., edge devices).
    Cloud/Edge Deployment: Deploy the final system either on edge devices (e.g., using NVIDIA Jetson) for local inference or on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Sagemaker, GCP AI Platform).

5. Testing, Validation, and Deployment (1-2 Months):

    Real-world Testing: Perform rigorous testing with real in-store footage to identify and resolve issues.
    Scalability Testing: Ensure the system can scale to handle multiple stores with minimal latency.
    Finalize Deployment: Deploy the system for actual use in stores, with ongoing monitoring for improvements.

Estimated Time and Cost for POC Development:

    Time Estimate:
        Total time for Proof of Concept: 9 to 12 months.
        This includes time for data collection, model training, real-time integration, and system testing.

    Cost Estimate:
        Hardware Costs: Surveillance cameras, edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson or Google Coral), and cloud services for storage and computation. (Approx. $10,000 - $30,000 based on scale).
        Software Development & AI Model Training: Time for research, training models, and building the infrastructure (Approx. $50,000 - $100,000 for a small to medium-sized retail environment).
        Deployment and Maintenance: Ongoing cost for updates, maintenance, and scalability (Approx. $10,000 - $20,000 annually).

Technology Stack:

    Programming Languages: Python (for AI/ML models), C++ (for performance optimization), JavaScript (for the alert system/dashboard)
    Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV (for video processing), TensorFlow or PyTorch (for machine learning models), YOLO, OpenPose (for behavior analysis), Flask/Django (for backend API), Twilio (for sending alerts).
    Edge Devices: NVIDIA Jetson or Google Coral for edge device deployment.
    Cloud Platforms: AWS, GCP, or Azure for scaling and model deployment.
    Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing logs and alert data.
    Alert System: Twilio API for SMS alerts, or custom dashboard for store security teams.

Key Challenges:

    Real-Time Processing: Achieving low-latency detection on edge devices is a significant challenge and may require optimizations.
    Behavioral Analysis Accuracy: Fine-tuning AI models to reliably detect theft behaviors with minimal false positives.
    Scalability: Ensuring that the solution can scale across multiple stores and handle the influx of video data from multiple cameras in real-time.

Conclusion:

This project will combine computer vision, behavioral analysis, and real-time processing to detect and prevent theft. While it requires significant development and integration, it has the potential to provide a robust solution for in-store theft detection. The Proof of Concept will help validate the approach and identify any critical issues before full-scale deployment.
